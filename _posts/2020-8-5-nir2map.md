[nir2watermap](https://github.com/ekrell/nir2watermap) is a newly launched github repo with simple tools for converting a Near-Infrared (NIR) image to a map for a marine robot.
NIR images have almost no spectral response in water, leaving those areas black in images. 
This tool exploits that to generate an occupancy grid for USV planning or other applications that require a raster grid of water bodies.
The occupancy grid can then be converted to polygons for applications such as [visibility graph-based planning](https://github.com/TaipanRex/pyvisgraph). 
To exclude unneeded cells when planning, there is an option to supply a start location; 
a flood fill is performed to block out all water cells that cannot be reached from the start.

While nautical charts and other map sources exist, (1) [NOAA ENCs are non-trivial for autonomous navigation](http://ccom.unh.edu/publications/autonomous-navigation-us-electronic-nautical-charts),
and (2) unmanned aerial vehicles can be readily equipped with NIR sensors. Thus, high-resolution, up-to-date maps could be generated after disasters such as floods or hurricanes to quickly enable USV path planning for response.

I have tested this with [Texas 2018-2019 NAIP imagery](https://tnris.org/news/2019-10-03/new-2018-2019-naip-statewide-aerial-imagery-now-available/). 
This is 60-cm aerial imagery with red, blue, green, and NIR bands. The example data below is from [Sunset Lake](https://www.visitcorpuschristitx.org/see-and-do/1998/sunset-lake-park) and the surrounding area in Portland, Texas.
Notice the cluster of small islands. 
These compose the Nueces Bay Marsh, a wetlands habitat restored by the [Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program](www.cbbep.org). 
I was involved with volunteer planting of [Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass)](https://txmarspecies.tamug.edu/vegdetails.cfm?scinameID=Spartina%20alterniflora). 
For autonomy, the marsh is a complex maze. I intend to use this region as a benchmark for planning algorithms where a USV should navigate through the islands. 
Deterministic algorithms such as Dijkstra and A* will find the path, but I expect very slowly. 
Metaheuristic approaches such as Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization are liable to get stuck in non-feasible solutions, where the path goes through and obstacle because most evolutions of the path yield even worse solutions. 
A single trial of PSO demonstrated this. Search space reduction techniques such as quadtrees and visibility graphs could help, though the later will be challenged by the [complexity of the polygons](https://github.com/TaipanRex/pyvisgraph/issues/48). 
You also have to consider the vehicle's turn radius when moving within the maze. Also, the following images reveal a caveat with the approach.
The accessible regions are split because of the long, thin strip across the map. However, this is a bridge that the vessel is underneath!
With the simple NIR-based approach implemented, all non-water pixels are obstacles.
