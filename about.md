### About Me

Evan Krell, graduate student at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi. 

### About Blog

The purpose of this blog is to record updates on my research to enable data-driven, adaptive online sampling for a USV exploring shallow coasts with a visual camera. I am working from the island university of TAMU-CC, surrounded by the extremely turbid Laguna Madre, Oso Bay, and Corpus Christi Bay. I am interested in using various machine learning techniques, supervised and unsupervised, for classification and novelty detection that will inform mission planning. Much of the challenge is to effectively use computer vision given the high turbidity.
